Debug Rubby:

inspect # inspecting objects, suitable for debugging.  E.g puts input.inspect

p # shortcut, works like puts, it calls inspect on each argument before printing it. E.g p input


Escape sequences:
puts '\n\t\"'  # output is \n\t\", most escape sequences are treated literally in single quoted strings.

method # list the metjods are available on an object. E.g puts 42.method, puts "hello".methods

class # list the class of the object. E.g 42.class, "hello".class

to_s .to_i .to_f # convert to a string, integer, float

raise # method to reort any errors., it stops what it's doing and prints your error message, it will exit immediately.
