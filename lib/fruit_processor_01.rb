# Instruction:
# create a fruit processor to process Apple and Banana, requirement is below:
# 1. they all have a property like color, weight
# 2. they all have method Process() and output is AppleJuice and BananaJuice and BlendJuice
# 3. they need to be initialized in the very beginning
# 4. there is a input for different fruits, but need to output a juice with
# 4.1 different weight (sum of existing fruit)
# 4.2 different color (red, yellow or blending)
